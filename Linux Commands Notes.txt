Fields/Column Description
PID    Process Id
USER   The effective user name of the task's owner

RES   The non-swapped physical memory a task has used
 
S   'D' = uninterruptible sleep
   'R' = running
   'S' = sleeping
   'T' = traced or stopped
   'Z' = zombie  
SHR   The amount of shared memory used by a task
%CPU  The task's share of the elapsed CPU time since the last screen update, expressed as a
   percentage of total CPU time.
%MEM   A task's currently used share of available physical memory
TIME+  Total CPU time the task has used since it started
  
Command  Display the command line used to start a task or the name of the associated program

Using awk command to list all users in Ubuntu
By using awk command we can get just the first field from the /etc/passwd file. Awk is a powerful text manipulation tool in Linux.

$ awk -F: '{ print $1}' /etc/passwd

Creating a new user
Apart from knowing how to list all users in Ubuntu, it is important also to know how to add a new user. To create a new user in Linux, use the following command:

$ useradd username
This will create a new entry in the /etc/passwd file

Get information about a particular user
You can use grep command to get information about a particular user from the /etc/passwd file. This is useful if there are a lot of users in the /etc/passwd file. This can help in checking for the existence of a particular user.

$ grep username /etc/passwd
Grep Username
We get information about a user named Adam from the /etc/passwd file.

sample shell script command
How to Write Shell Script in Linux/Unix
Shell Scripts are written using text editors. On your Linux system, open a text editor program, open a new file to begin typing a shell script or shell programming, then give the shell permission to execute your shell script and put your script at the location from where the shell can find it.

Let us understand the steps in creating a Shell Script:

Create a file using a vi editor(or any other editor). Name script file with extension .sh
Start the script with #! /bin/sh
Write some code.
Save the script file as filename.sh
For executing the script type bash filename.sh
“#!” is an operator called shebang which directs the script to the interpreter location. So, if we use”#! /bin/sh” the script gets directed to the bourne-shell.

Let’s create a small script –

#!/bin/sh
#Sample 1
ls

#!/bin/sh
#Sample 2
echo "what is your name?"
read name
echo "How do you do, $name?"
read remark
echo "I am $remark too!"

ps -ef | grep sshd to check SSH is running


Password settings change for EC2 Intances
cd /etc/ssh/ Go to this path
vi sshd_config is the file comend password and enable the setting

/etc/ssh are directories

 systemctl restart sshd to restart sshd if we make any changes on authentication
 
C:\Users\Navaneethan C is the home directory in windows

cat /etc/passwd|grep root to know the directory of the user grep username you looking for

to view users 

cd /etc/
the cat passwd to view list of users

Linux curl command is used to download or upload data to a server via supported protocols such as HTTP, FTP, IMAP, SFTP, TFTP, IMAP, POP3, SCP, etc. It is a remote utility, so it works without user interaction. The data transfer from one place to another is one of the vital and most used tasks of a computer system.
